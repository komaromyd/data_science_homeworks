A relational database management system is a system in which 1. data are stored in tabular form, in the form of several tables 2. one or more columns of of each table is connected to one or more column of other tables, i.e. to every element of a certain column of table A there are additional data in table B, 3. these relationships (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many) are clearly defined in a separate document, 4. the system is programmed in a way so that data are searchable based on their relationship to each other in so-called quieries 5. the data are editable (entries can be added, removed or modified) but the queries don't change the data.

SQL (structured query language) is a programming language that enables searching for data in a structured manner in a relational database
